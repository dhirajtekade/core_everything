This directory contains files to upgrade from various versions of the library.

Each upgrade file must have his filename matching the pattern
<4digityear><2digitmonth><2digitday>_from_<version>_to_<version>.sql
Every other file will be ignored.

These files contain a generic upgrade to the tables generated by Baobab, so their
content isn't meant to be used "as is", but it should be changed to match the
name of the trees used when creating Baobab instances.

FOR AN EASY UPGRADE JUST CALL
Baobab::upgrade()
